password123
--------------------------------------------

password123 is a command-line tool for checking if one of the 10,000 most commonly used.

I made this tool because it was easy to make, but perhaps someone will find it useful. Password123
is written in Python and is therefore not very performant, so it is unsuitable for malicious purposes.

The list of passwords was compiled by Mark Burnett of [xato.net](https://xato.net/about/).
